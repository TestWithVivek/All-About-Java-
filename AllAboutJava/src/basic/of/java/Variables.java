		1. Local Cariable: 
		2. Globle variable : 1. Static variable and 2. Non static variable
		
		 
		1. Local Variable: 
				- can be declared inside the method only 
				- Scope is within the method only 
				- It could be any method like static, non-static or even main method 
		
		2. Static Variable:
				- Its a type of globle variable 
				- it declared with the static keyword
				- its scopt is outside the method and class as well, but to access it outside the class, we need to replace static keyword with public
				- it can be accessed outside the package as well 
				- withing the class we can call it directly 
				- outside the class we have to call it -> ClassName.variableName
				- outside the package we have to call it -> ClassName.variableName but the variable we have to change from static to public and need to import the class with import keyword
				
		3. Non- static Variable / Instance Variable
				- Its a type of globle variabl 
				- its scope is within the class 
				- it can be accessed inside the class by creating the object 
				- it can be accessed outside the package with the help of object 
				- We dont need static keyword here
